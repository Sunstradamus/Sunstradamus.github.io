<h1>Hi, I'm Andy.</h1>

<p>I'm currently a computer science graduate student researching computer systems and networks. I make slow things go fast, fast things faster, and faster things cheaper. My areas of expertise are in low-latency offloading, soft real-time systems, analytical computer vision, and security analysis.</p>

<p>My interest in computers started with MapleStory in 2004 when I was first introduced to "highly optimized gameplay", Ã  la hacking. I met some interesting people on various forums who showed me the basics, and it went from there. Over time, I moved into the private server scene for ROSE Online and World of Warcraft, picking up my networking background. Eventually, I obtained a formal CS education in my undergraduate years, graduating with distinction.</p>
